/**
 * Migration closure facts for adopt-plan (FND-070, formalized by the
 * migration manifest contract).
 *
 * Everything here is strictly read-only and pure: adoption never mutates
 * the target, and completion is a judgement computed from filesystem facts
 * plus the target's own migration manifest. The kit never deletes legacy
 * implementations itself — it only reports whether they have exited.
 *
 * The target declares its migration state in `skill-family.migration.json`,
 * which is a formal Contract (migration-manifest, Contracts 1.1.1):
 *
 *   {
 *     "schemaVersion": 1,
 *     "kind": "skill-family.migration-manifest",
 *     "legacyInfra": [ { "path": "scripts/old-validator.mjs", "replacedBy": "sf-kit check" } ],
 *     "exceptions": [ { "owner": "...", "reason": "...", "deadline": "2026-12-31", "migrationTarget": "..." } ]
 *   }
 *
 * The manifest loader distinguishes missing / parse-failed / schema-invalid /
 * valid; only a valid manifest counts as declared. Temporary exceptions are
 * only accepted when all four fields are present and non-blank; a missing
 * field fails the plan (conflict), an expired deadline is never auto-renewed
 * (risk + completion blocker). Every user-provided legacy path is assessed
 * through harness containment: escapes fail closed and never reveal whether
 * an outside path exists.
